Hey, I'm Harshita Thota, a 19-year-old pursuing Computer Science at the University of Illinois Urbana Champaign.
My passion for lifting led me to create a workout logger tailored to my routines, exercises, and progress tracking
methods. It's a perfect blend of my interest in programming and fitness. When I first started lifting, I couldn't
bench the bar (45 lbs), but through weeks of hard work, I built up the strength to do it. Despite wanting progress,
I fell in love with lifting for the sheer joy of moving weight. The routine of driving to the gym while blasting music,
and feeling cracked even without pre-workout is PEAK vibes. This journey has not only transformed me physically but also 
instilled discipline and resilience in other aspects of my life. I'm excited to add more features to the workout logger
(progressive overload calculator whaaaa?!?!). Stay tuned for updates!
